# Handwritten Digit Recognition

## Overview

This repository contains a Deep Learning project focused on recognizing handwritten digits using a Neural Network. The project leverages the MNIST dataset, a classic dataset consisting of images of handwritten digits from 0 to 9. The goal is to build a model that can accurately classify these digits based on the provided images.

## Project Structure

- **src/**: Source code for model training and evaluation.
- **README.md**: This file.

## Requirements

To run this project, you need to have the following packages installed:

- TensorFlow
- NumPy

You can install these packages using pip:

`pip install tensorflow numpy`

## Results

The trained model achieves high accuracy **(97%)** in recognizing handwritten digits. Detailed performance metrics are available in the `src/` directory.
